  <!-- Who would have thogught that writing a dark theme is that easy.
  Currently this doesn't do much in Gecko, so either you try not to use `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` or
  you manually define dark styles for the whole page (for which there may be a library that is suitable for
  default-styled pages). Or you wait until https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1525107
  is resolved.
  The same applies to the other pages of this extension. -->
