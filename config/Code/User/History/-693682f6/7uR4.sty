Member Data:
I have experience into programming a wide family of micontrollers, such as 8-bit PIC family (16F and 18F), ESP32, and ESP8266, as well as 32-bits ST microcontrollers from ST family. Additionally I have experience developing in a variant of Arduino boards like arduino uno and nano. I also have experience working with embedded systems like Raspberry Pi. I have programmed this platforms in C and C++. Besides, i have experience in hardware description using Verilog and VHDL. Moreover, in 3D design and printing, and PCB design.

I have developed several projects. Between there a sign language recognition glove; an IoT doorbell that include a camera and connect it with an HTTP server and a digital signal generator based on a FPGA for signal generation and a Raspberry Pi for the graphical interface.

Regarding control systems, I have knowledge in classical and modern control theory. I have worked on developing digital filters, which has allowed me to gain a solid understanding of both digital and analog signal processing principles.
