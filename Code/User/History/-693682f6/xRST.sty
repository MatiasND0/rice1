Member Data:
I have experience with multiple families of microcontrollers, such as the 8-bit PIC family, ESP32, and ESP8266, as well as 32-bit microcontrollers from the ST family and various Arduino boards. I also have experience with embedded systems, including Raspberry Pi. I have programmed these platforms in C and C++. Additionally, I have knowledge of Python and JavaScript. Furthermore, I have experience in hardware description using Verilog and VHDL, as well as in 3D design and printing, and PCB design.

I have worked on several projects, such as a sign language recognition glove and an IoT doorbell that includes a camera and telemetry on an HTTP server, among other personal projects. I have also worked on a signal generator using an FPGA for signal generation and a Raspberry Pi for the graphical interface.

Regarding control systems, I possess knowledge in classical and modern control. I have worked on developing digital filters, which has allowed me to gain a solid understanding of both digital and analog signal processing principles.
